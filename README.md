# Stock Market Simulator
My project is a simulator for the stock market. A user begins with $10,000 and is presented with availible stocks. They are also given a news story that will affect the market. You have 3 rounds to make as much cash as possible. The twist is that everytime you invest in a round the news story changes. The last news story that is given is the true one that will affect the market. Good Luck1
